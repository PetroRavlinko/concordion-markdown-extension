# Concordion Markdown Extension

## Philosophy

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) provides an easy-to-read and easy-to-write syntax for converting plain text to structured XHTML.

This Concordion Markdown extension allows you to write your [Concordion](http://concordion.org/) specification in the Markdown format, converting the Markdown to XHTML at runtime and running the resultant XHTML as a Concordion specification. 

## Overview

See the [README](https://github.com/concordion/concordion-markdown-extension/blob/master/README.md) for an overview.
